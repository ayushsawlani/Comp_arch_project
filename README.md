1.) Memory.txt file acts as the main memory of our emulation. <br>
2.) Cache.cpp Has an internal cache array and also access to Memory.txt. <br> 
3.) The .trace files are input to my program. They will have 2 types of queries 1.)Store and 2.) Retrieve <br>
4.) Based on the algorithm, decisions will be taken on what we should store in the cache array. <br>
5.) The hit rate is defined as the number of times the queried memory block was found in cache array divided by total number retrieve calls. <br>
6.) Hence, the choice of algorithm will affect the hit rate. <br>
7.) It was concluded that increasing the size of cache memory increased hit rate.
